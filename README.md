In order to run PSET Buddies, you need to have everything consolidated into one folder, similar to the Finance PSET. After changing your directory
to the psetbuddies folder, you can execute the flask run command and this will enable you to run the website.

The first step after running the website is to create an account and log in. After this has been completed, you will be redirected to the index page which shoiuld not have any entries to the table of matches (because there are no matches yet). You, as the user, will have to then click on the availability link in the navbar and input your single course preference and time availability.

In order for the entry to be accurate to the database, when the user MUST click the "update" button every time before submitting the preferences. If they don't do this, then there will be an inaccurate reflection of time preferences and mess up the matching algorithm. Hence, it is critical for the user to always press the update button before submitting this form.

Because I have already preloaded entries of other users course preferences and availabilities, you can immediately test out to see if you are currently matching with any user. You can also check out the matches page, which can be directed to via the navbar, which shows a history of the matches a person has gotten broken into which day they matched on as well.

One major clarification is that the index page won't reflect existing user matches upon initial login because the user matches are only reflected once the user has matched with another user. Thus, when logging in the user has to update their availability slot and then they will see in their index a list of the names of their matches etc. If the user wants to see existing matches, the best way to access this information is by clicking the "matches" page which will show a history of all the matches that the user has had.
